## Introduction

Welcome to the 30XX Game Trainer project! This repository contains a trainer program for the game 30XX. The trainer is designed to enhance the player's experience by providing various in-game advantages. The project is developed using C# and .NET Framework 4.8.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to serve as a learning experience for both game modification and programming. By developing a trainer for 30XX, we aim to:

- Gain insights into game memory manipulation.
- Understand how to create a trainer interface.
- Improve our programming skills in C#.
- Learn how to collaborate on a software project using version control.

## Features

Our trainer project currently includes the following features:

- **Memoria:** Access and modify in-game memory values.
- **Titan Shards:** Increase the number of Titan Shards.
- **Nuts - Magic Number:** Modify the magic number for Nuts.
- **Nuts:** Increase the number of Nuts.
- **Cubes:** Collect more Cubes for upgrades.
- **Player 1 and Player 2:**
  - **HP:** Set the health points.
  - **Max HP:** Adjust the maximum health points.
  - **EN:** Modify the energy points.
  - **Max EN:** Adjust the maximum energy points.
  - **Attack Points:** Boost the attack points.
  - **Power Points:** Increase the power points.
  - **Speed Points:** Enhance the speed points.
  - **Jump Points:** Improve the jump points.
  - **Cores:** Modify the number of Cores.

Please note that the availability of these features may depend on the game version and other factors. Use this trainer responsibly and follow all terms of use provided by the game developers.

These features are just the beginning, and we plan to expand the trainer's capabilities over time.
