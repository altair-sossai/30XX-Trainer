## Introduction

Welcome to the 30XX Game Trainer project! This repository contains a trainer program for the game 30XX. The trainer is designed to enhance the player's experience by providing various in-game advantages. The project is developed using C# and .NET Framework 4.8.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to serve as a learning experience for both game modification and programming. By developing a trainer for 30XX, we aim to:

- Gain insights into game memory manipulation.
- Understand how to create a trainer interface.
- Improve our programming skills in C#.
- Learn how to collaborate on a software project using version control.

## Features

Our trainer project currently includes the following features:

- **Infinite Health:** Maintain maximum health throughout the gameplay.
- **Unlimited Energy:** Never run out of energy for special abilities.
- **Enhanced Weapons:** Boost weapon damage and effectiveness.

These features are just the beginning, and we plan to expand the trainer's capabilities over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Install the game 30XX on your computer.
- Make sure you have [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the solution using your preferred C# development environment.

## Usage

1. Launch the 30XX game.
2. Run the trainer executable you built.
3. Use the trainer interface to enable or disable various cheats according to your preference.

Remember, this trainer is intended for **single-player** and **offline** use only.

## Cheat Engine Table

Alongside the trainer program, we provide a Cheat Engine table (`cheat_engine_table.CT`) that contains memory addresses and pointers for important variables within the 30XX game. You can use this table to further explore the game's memory and develop additional cheats.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the trainer's functionality and compatibility. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your enhancements.
4. Submit a pull request.
